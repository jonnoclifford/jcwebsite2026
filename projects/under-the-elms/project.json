Another suggestion of the origin of the term is that participants would go out under the guise of taking the dog for a walk; an effort to keep their illicit outdoor pursuits hidden from family members.\n\nOf more than two hundred Public Sex Environments (P.S.E) or 'dogging spots', known to police across the UK, almost half of these exist in Surrey, with many of them listed online as being in various towns throughout Elmbridge. Innocuous sites such as wooded lanes, parks and roadside lay-bys become something entirely different, serving a purpose for which they were never intended.\n\nAlthough participants run the risk of being prosecuted for a number of offences related to public display of sexual behaviour, the laws pertaining to dogging remain ambiguous and so the practice continues, much to the dismay of many of the locals residents.",
